   MAEDMAX
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Maedmax implements ordered completion, extending the Maxcomp tool [0].

Besides OCaml, camlp4, ocamlfind, and Ocamlbuild [1], it requires Yices [2], the
OCamlYices [3] bindings for OCaml, and the json library Yojson [4] as well as
xml-light [5] for output.

Using OCamlbuild, the Maedmax executable can be created by executing
 $ make
in this directory.


The usage of Maedmax is as follows:

 $ ./maedmax <options> <input>

The input file can be in TPTP [6] or trs format [7].

Options are the following:
--analyze
  only prints some characteristics extracted from the input problem
--cpf
  if a goal is given and Maedmax can prove it, it will output the proof in
  CPF [8], such that it can be checked by CeTA [9].
--json
  upon success, statistics are output in json format 
--kb
  apply standard Knuth-Bendix completion, rather than ordered completion
--term
  only check termination of the input system
--xsig
  assume the underlying signature to have infinitely many constants
-D
  trigger debugging output
-K <k>
  in every iteration <k> TRSs are chosen
-M <mode>
  <mode> may be one of the predefined strategies kbauto, olpo, okbo, olpokbo,
  where the first one is for Knuth-Bendix completion and the others for 
  ordered completion
-T <t> 
  give a timeout in seconds
-N <n>
 the number of equations that get activated for a TRS
